# potato
We decided to do a Potato website because we are both potato enthusiasts.
We decided to use the header font, Poppins, because we felt that it had a asthetic to go along with the page. 
We decided to use the font, Sniglet, to be our body font because we felt it went nicely with the other font. 
The colors on the website were choosen because we felt they added to the asthetic of the page.
