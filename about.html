        <h3>About and History</h3>
        <p>It's 1536 and Spanish Conquistadors have just taken over Peru, discovering the potato. The potato was taken to Europe and spread to the civilians. The Irish took a liking to them, and soon everyone in the working class were eating potatoes. Potatoes today have become a staple of sides and you can get a potato anywhere you go.</p>
        <p>Potatoes have different types, including russet potatoes, red potatoes, white potatoes, yellow potatoes, purple/blue potatoes, fingerling potatoes, and petite potatoes. These potatoes can be cooked, shaped, and/or mashed to make a variation of all kinds.</p>
